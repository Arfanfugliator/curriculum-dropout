# Curriculum Dropout
[Dropout](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf) is a very effective way of regularizing neural networks. Stochastically "dropping out" units with a certain probability discourages over-specific co-adaptations of feature detectors, preventing overfitting and improving network generalization. However, we show that using a fixed dropout probability during training is a suboptimal choice. We propose a time scheduling for the probability of retaining neurons in the network. This induces an adaptive regularization scheme that smoothly increases the difficulty of the optimization problem. This idea of "starting easy" and adaptively increasing the difficulty of the learning problem has its roots in [curriculum learning](https://ronan.collobert.com/pub/matos/2009_curriculum_icml.pdf) and allows one to train better models. Indeed, we prove that our optimization strategy implements a very general curriculum scheme, by gradually adding noise to both the input and intermediate feature representations in the network architecture. The method, named **Curriculum Dropout**, yields to better generalization.

## Code
Each sub-folder (*...in progress...*) is named after the dataset analyzed and equipped with its own README. The provided code runs with Python 2.7 (should run with Python 3 as well, not tested). For the installation of ``tensorflow-gpu`` please refer to the [website](http://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

The following command should install the main dependencies on most Linux (Ubuntu) machines

``
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip &&
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
``
#### Download and extract MNIST
* The script ``download.sh`` downloads and extracts mnist. Deafult storing directory is ```~/mnist folder```.

```
sudo chmod a+x download.sh
./download.sh
```
